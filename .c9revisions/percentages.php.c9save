{"ts":1375910953679,"patch":[[{"diffs":[[0,"     <p>"],[1,"In mathematics, a percentage is a number or ratio as a fraction of 100. It is often denoted using the percent sign, “%”, or the abbreviation “pct.”\nFor example, 45% (read as “forty-five percent”) is equal to 45/100, or 0.45. A related system which expresses a number as a fraction of 1,000 uses the terms \"per mil\" and \"millage\". Percentages are used to express how large/small one quantity is, relative to another quantity. The first quantity usually represents a part of, or a change in, the second quantity, which should be greater than zero. For example, an increase of $ 0.15 on a price of $ 2.50 is an increase by a fraction of 0.15/2.50 = 0.06. Expressed as a percentage, this is therefore a 6% increase. The word 'percent' means 'out of 100' or 'per 100'."],[0,"</p>\n   "]],"start1":682,"start2":682,"length1":16,"length2":779}]],"length":2775,"saved":false}
